# AI Liquidity Engine

### **AI Liquidity Engine**

Managing liquidity across multiple DeFi platforms is both complex and risky, despite the potential yield opportunities. Amplified's AI-driven Liquidity Engine simplifies this process by optimizing real-time asset allocation across various DeFi protocols.&#x20;

Using advanced models like ARIMA, LSTM, and reinforcement learning, the engine predicts APYs while applying strategies such as Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) to enhance returns. Risk is effectively controlled through models like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), providing users with efficient, risk-adjusted returns.

### **How the AI Rebalancer and ALM System Work:**

1. **Data Inputs**: Our AI system continuously aggregates real-time data from various DeFi protocols like Uniswap V3, [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi), Aave, and Yearn.finance. This includes metrics such as APYs, liquidity levels, slippage, gas fees, and market volatility.
2. **Feature Engineering**: The AI processes this data to extract key features that indicate the current and predicted performance of each liquidity pool or staking position. These features include historical yield patterns, volatility measures, liquidity shifts, and correlation metrics between different assets.
3. **Time Series Forecasting**: To predict the future APYs of different pools, the AI employs time series forecasting models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. These models are particularly effective at capturing temporal dependencies and long-term trends in the APY data, enabling the protocol to anticipate shifts in yield opportunities.
4. **Optimization Algorithms**: The AI rebalance employs optimization algorithms such as Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and more advanced techniques like Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO). These methods help determine the ideal asset allocation that maximizes returns while minimizing risk based on the predicted APYs and the correlation between different assets in the vault.
5. **Smart Contracts**: Once the AI rebalance determines the optimal asset allocation, the vault manager creates an on-chain proposal that should be signed by other signature delegates. The protocol’s smart contracts then execute these strategies automatically.

## Methodology

#### Data Aggregation and Feature Engineering

The AI Liquidity Engine continuously aggregates real-time data from the integrated DeFi protocols. Key metrics collected include:

* **Annual Percentage Yields (APYs)**
* **Liquidity Levels**
* **Slippage Rates**
* **Gas Fees**
* **Market Volatility**

Feature engineering is performed to extract informative features such as:

* **Historical Yield Patterns**
* **Volatility Measures**
* **Liquidity Shifts**
* **Asset Correlations**

#### Time Series Forecasting Models

**ARIMA Model**

The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is employed to capture linear trends and seasonality in APY data.

**LSTM Networks**

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are utilized to model non-linear dependencies and long-term temporal patterns in the data.

**Sample Python Code for LSTM Model:**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Load APY data
data = pd.read_csv('apy_data.csv')
apy = data['APY'].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Normalize data
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
apy_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(apy)

# Prepare training data
look_back = 10
X, Y = [], []
for i in range(len(apy_scaled) - look_back - 1):
    X.append(apy_scaled[i:(i + look_back), 0])
    Y.append(apy_scaled[i + look_back, 0])
X = np.array(X)
Y = np.array(Y)
X = np.reshape(X, (X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))

# Build LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(look_back, 1)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# Train model
model.fit(X, Y, epochs=20, batch_size=1, verbose=2)
```

#### Optimization Techniques

**Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**

MPT is used to construct a portfolio that offers the maximum expected return for a given level of risk.

**Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)**

MVO extends MPT by considering the variance (risk) of portfolio returns and the covariance between assets.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Maximize:&#x20;

$$
\mu_p = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \mu_i
$$

Subject to:&#x20;

$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
$$

Where:

* ( \mu\_p ) = Expected portfolio return
* ( w\_i ) = Weight of asset ( i )
* ( \mu\_i ) = Expected return of asset ( i )
* ( \sigma\_{ij} ) = Covariance between asset ( i ) and ( j )

#### Risk Management Models

**Value at Risk (VaR)**

VaR estimates the potential loss in portfolio value over a defined period for a given confidence interval.

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**

CVaR provides the expected loss exceeding the VaR threshold, offering a more comprehensive risk assessment.

## Simulation and Results

To validate the effectiveness of the AI Liquidity Engine, we simulate asset allocation strategies over a historical period.

#### Simulation Setup

* **Assets**: Selection of LSTs and LRTs (e.g., stETH, sfrxETH, eETH)
* **Time Frame**: Past 12 months
* **Metrics Evaluated**:
  * Portfolio Return
  * Portfolio Volatility
  * Sharpe Ratio

#### Results

| Strategy                | Return (%) | Volatility (%) | Sharpe Ratio |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Equal Weighting         | 8.5        | 12.0           | 0.71         |
| AI Optimized Allocation | **12.3**   | **9.5**        | **1.29**     |

The AI-optimized allocation outperforms the equal weighting strategy, demonstrating higher returns with lower volatility.

## Appendix

#### Extended Mathematical Formulations

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**

CVaR is calculated as:

$$
\text{CVaR}\alpha = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \int\alpha^1 \text{VaR}_u du
$$

Where:

* ( \alpha ) = Confidence level
* ( \text{VaR}\_u ) = Value at Risk at confidence level ( u )

**Reinforcement Learning Objective**

The goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward:

$$
\max_\pi \mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t \right]
$$

Where:

* ( \pi ) = Policy function
* ( \gamma ) = Discount factor
* ( r\_t ) = Reward at time ( t )

***

#### Additional Code Example: Portfolio Optimization using CVaR

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Load asset returns
returns = pd.read_csv('asset_returns.csv')
mean_returns = returns.mean()
cov_matrix = returns.cov()

# Define CVaR optimization function
def cvar_objective(weights, returns, alpha=0.95):
    portfolio_returns = returns.dot(weights)
    var = np.percentile(portfolio_returns, (1 - alpha) * 100)
    cvar = portfolio_returns[portfolio_returns <= var].mean()
    return -cvar  # Negative for minimization

# Constraints and bounds
constraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda x: np.sum(x) - 1})
bounds = tuple((0, 1) for _ in range(len(mean_returns)))

# Initial guess
init_guess = np.array(len(mean_returns) * [1. / len(mean_returns)])

# Optimization
opt_result = minimize(cvar_objective, init_guess, args=(returns,), method='SLSQP',
                      bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)

optimal_weights = opt_result.x
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to perform portfolio optimization by minimizing CVaR, providing a more robust risk assessment compared to traditional variance-based methods.
