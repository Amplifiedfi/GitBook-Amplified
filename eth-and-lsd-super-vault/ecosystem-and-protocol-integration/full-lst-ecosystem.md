# Full LST Ecosystem

### **Maximizing Yield with Liquid Staking and Reward Tokens**

In the fast-paced world of DeFi, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Reward Tokens (LRTs) offer new ways to optimize yield while preserving liquidity. Amplified Protocol harnesses the power of these innovations through its Super Vault, which integrates a variety of LSTs and LRTs.&#x20;

This setup enables users to unlock higher yields, lower risk, and access a strong investment vehicle that fully capitalizes on the potential of liquid staking derivatives.

## Understanding Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Reward Tokens (LRTs)

#### Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)

LSTs represent staked assets that are tokenized, allowing holders to maintain liquidity while earning staking rewards. By holding LSTs, investors can:

* **Earn Staking Rewards**: Continue to receive rewards from the underlying staked assets.
* **Maintain Liquidity**: Trade or use LSTs in DeFi applications without waiting for unstaking periods.
* **Participate in DeFi**: Utilize LSTs as collateral, in yield farming, or other financial strategies.

#### Liquid Reward Tokens (LRTs)

LRTs are tokens that represent accumulated rewards from staking or other yield-generating activities. They enable:

* **Reward Reinvestment**: Automatically reinvest rewards to compound returns.
* **Flexibility**: Separate reward management from the principal investment.

## Overview of Amplified Protocol Super Vault

The Amplified Protocol Super Vault is an advanced asset management system that aggregates and reallocates user assets across a diversified portfolio of LSTs and LRTs. Built on top of re-staking protocols, the Super Vault employs sophisticated strategies to:

* **Maximize Yield**: Optimize returns by allocating assets to the most profitable opportunities.
