# Point & Referral System

Welcome to the Amplified Protocol Point Systemâ€”designed to reward your contributions to our DeFi and LST/LRT ecosystem. Whether you're new or experienced, this guide explains how the system works, how you can benefit, and why you should get involved.

### **What Is the Point System?**

The Point System rewards early adopters and active community members for supporting the Amplified ecosystem. Earn points by participating, boosting your status and increasing your chances of receiving LLT tokens during our airdrop.

### **Referral System: Build and Lead Your Squad**

Introduce Friends to Amplified. For every new user you refer who deposits ETH into the Amplified vault, you earn 20% of their points based on their deposit amount. You also earn 10% of the points from second-level referrals, amplifying your earning potential.\
Example:

* Level 1 Referral: You refer Alice, who deposits 5 ETH. You earn points based on her deposit.
* Level 2 Referral: Alice refers Bob, who deposits 3 ETH. You earn additional points from Bob's deposit.

### **Amplify Your Influence: Grow Your Referral Network**

Grow a thriving community. The larger and more active your squad becomes, the more points you accumulate. Your leadership in building a strong community reflects in your point total.\
Benefits:

* Establish yourself as a key influencer within the Amplified ecosystem.
* Unlock higher earning tiers as your squad grows.

### **Boost Your Earnings: Increase Points with ETH Deposits**

Deposit ETH to earn more points. The total amount of ETH deposited by you and your referrals significantly boosts your point accumulation. Larger deposits not only increase your yield but also elevate your point earnings.\
Example:

* If you deposit 2 ETH, you earn 2 points per hour.
* If your referral deposits 15 ETH, you earn points based on their higher deposit tier.

### **Engage and Earn: Participate in Community Activities**

Take part in special events to earn more points. Completing quests, participating in meme contests, and engaging in partner collaborations can all boost your earnings. Stay updated with announcements on Discord and Twitter to never miss these opportunities.
