# How it works?

Earning points is simple and rewarding. Here's how the system works:

**1. Referrals:** Introduce your friends to the power of simplified LST yields with Amplified! For every user you successfully refer who joins and deposits ETH, you earn points based on their deposit amount and their activity within the protocol.

**2. Squad Growth:** Building a strong community is at the heart of Amplified. As your referred users (your "squad") grow, so do your points. The larger and more active your squad, the more points you accumulate, reflecting your leadership and influence within the Amplified community.

**3. Total Deposits:** We value those who believe in the long-term potential of Amplified. The total amount of ETH deposited by your referrals contributes to your point total, demonstrating your ability to attract committed users to the platform.

**4. Community Activities:** We're always exploring new and engaging ways to reward our community. From participating in quests and campaigns to collaborating with our partners, you'll have opportunities to earn bonus points by actively contributing to the Amplified ecosystem.
