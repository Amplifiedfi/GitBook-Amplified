# What is the Point System?

The Point System is a way for us to measure and appreciate the dedication of our early adopters. By participating in various activities that support the Amplified ecosystem, you earn points that reflect your engagement and contribution to our community. These points increase your chances of receiving a portion of the AMPL token airdrop reserved for our most loyal members.
