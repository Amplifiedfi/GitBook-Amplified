# What is the Point System?

Welcome to the Amplified Protocol Point Systemâ€”a dynamic way to earn more while contributing to the growth of our decentralized finance and LST/LRT ecosystem. Whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned professional, this guide will walk you through how our point system works, how you can benefit, and why you should get involved today.

### What Is the Point System?

The Point System is our way of recognizing and rewarding the dedication of our early adopters and active community members. By engaging in various activities that support the Amplified ecosystem, you earn points that reflect your contribution and involvement. These points not only boost your status within the community but also increase your chances of receiving a generous allocation of LLT tokens during our airdrop when the protocol reaches a Total Value Locked of $1 billion.
