# ðŸ’» Autonomous Vault Infrastructure

Amplified's Super Vault and liquidity infrastructure powers autonomous structured products, acting as both the liquidity and abstraction layer between end users and LSDfi markets. This simplifies DeFi portfolio management, maximizes liquidity flows, and optimizes capital efficiency across the LSD Capital Markets.

### **Demystifying the Super Vault: An Overview**

Amplified offers an advanced Autonomous Vault Infrastructure tailored for ETH and BTC Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs). It marks a significant shift from manual curated strategy execution, providing fully on-chain, autonomous management of complex DeFi strategies. By seamlessly integrating key componentsâ€”volatility management, staking yields, liquidity flows, and capital rebalancingâ€”Amplified transforms these into accessible, tradable assets for investors.

#### **Core Interactions**

* **ETH Deposits:** Users deposit ETH into the Super Vault, which acts as the primary asset for all subsequent LST investments.
* **Reward Aggregation:** Yield generated from various LST positions is automatically collected and compounded within the Super Vault, maximizing your returns over time.
* **ETH Withdrawals:** Users can withdraw their ETH along with accrued yields at any time, subject to any applicable fees or lockup periods.

#### **Core Components**

* **Autonomous Strategy Execution:** Amplifiedâ€™s fully autonomous vault infrastructure manages execution and rebalancing of strategies without human intervention, dynamically optimizing portfolios in real-time for risk-adjusted returns.
* **Volatility Tokenization:** Amplified captures DeFi market volatility, converting it into yield-bearing assets and tradable opportunities, allowing investors to capitalize on market fluctuations.
* **Risk & Liquidity Optimization:** Amplified autonomously manages staking and restaking strategies, rebalancing across protocols to maximize yield, liquidity, and risk-adjusted portfolio performance.
* **On-Chain Structured Products:** Amplified supports leveraged trading and derivatives, enabling tokenized hedge fund capabilities with institutional-grade risk management, providing both retail and institutional investors with access to advanced DeFi tools.

#### **On-chain Trustless Vaults**

Amplified is built on the principles of decentralization and transparency. All interactions with the protocol, from depositing ETH to claiming rewards, occur on-chain, ensuring complete transparency and verifiability. The smart contracts governing the Super Vault's logic are publicly available for review, fostering trust and accountability within the Amplified ecosystem.
