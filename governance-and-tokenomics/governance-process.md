# Governance Process

**Proposal Submission:** Any AMPL holder can submit a governance proposal outlining their proposed changes to the protocol, along with a detailed rationale and supporting data.

**Community Discussion:** Submitted proposals undergo a period of community discussion and debate, allowing AMPL holders to voice their opinions, ask questions, and refine the proposal if needed.

**On-Chain Voting:** Following the discussion period, AMPL holders cast their votes on the proposal using their staked tokens. The outcome of the vote determines whether the proposal is implemented or rejected.
