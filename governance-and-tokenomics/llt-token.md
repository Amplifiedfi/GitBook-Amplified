# LLT Token

## Governance Rights

LLT holders possess significant authority in shaping the future of the Amplified protocol. They can propose and vote on a wide range of governance matters, including:

* **Protocol Upgrades**: Introducing new features, functionalities, and improvements. Governance can update the protocol via proxy contracts and has the ability to pause deposits and withdrawals if necessary.
* **Strategy Parameters**: Adjusting risk parameters, allocation limits, and whitelisting LST/LRT assets and DeFi protocols for existing and future strategies.
* **Fee Structure**: Modifying protocol fees to ensure fairness and sustainability.
* **Treasury Management**: Deciding on the utilization, investment, or distribution of the protocol's treasury funds.
* **Protocol and Strategy Executors**: Setting and managing external strategy managers, oracles, and on-chain relayers responsible for rebalancing strategies and compounding external vaults.

## Staking and Voting Power

* **Staking LLT**: Users can stake their LLT tokens in the staking contract to receive **weLoveLLT** tokens, which represent their voting power.
* **Voting Power Enhancement**: Voting power starts at a 1:1 ratio (weLoveLLT). Users can increase their voting power up to a 1:2 ratio by locking up their LLT tokens for up to 5 years, incentivizing long-term commitment.
* **Delegation**: Users can delegate their **weLoveLLT** voting power to other wallets, allowing for flexible participation and representation.
