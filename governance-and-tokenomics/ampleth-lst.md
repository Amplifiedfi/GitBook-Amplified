# amplETH LST

Amplified's token model carefully balances the interests of various stakeholders to promote the platform's sustainability, decentralization, and user incentives. Core aspects include:

**1. amplETH LST**&#x20;

* **Representation:** The amplETH LST token represents a user's share of the LSD re-staking pools within Amplified.
* **Value Accrual:** The token's value increases as:
  * LSDs are re-staked across Eigenlayer validators, earning additional staking rewards.
  * Re-staked LSDs are utilized in DeFi yield generating strategies across various chains.
  * Platform fees are collected and redistributed to amplETH LP holders.
* **Liquidity:** Designed to remain liquid, allowing amplETH LP holders to trade their tokens or utilize them in DeFi protocols.

**2. Token Distribution (coming soon)**

Amplified adopts a transparent token allocation with a focus on incentivizing community participation and long-term platform development.&#x20;

**3. Economic Incentives and Sustainability**

Amplified's tokenomics aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem with aligned incentives for its stakeholders:

* **LP Rewards:** High yields on LSD re-staking and DeFi strategies attract liquidity providers, strengthening the platform.
* **Fee Model:** Amplified generates revenue through a small percentage fee on user yields. Fees must be competitive and transparent to ensure continued adoption. A portion of fees can be allocated to amplETH holders through buybacks or staking rewards.
* **Token Utility:** The amplETH token may offer additional benefits beyond yield accrual, such as:
  * Boosted rewards within certain pools
  * Access to exclusive yield optimization strategies.
  * Tiered governance rights

**5. References and Best Practices from DeFi and Re-Staking Protocols**

Amplified's tokenomics builds on lessons learned from successful projects:

* **Curve Finance (CRV):** Employs a vote-escrow system where locking CRV for longer periods grants increased governance power and rewards. Amplified could adopt a similar system.
* **Lido (LDO):** Allocates a portion of protocol fees for Lido DAO development and insurance coverage. Amplified may use fees similarly to strengthen its treasury.
* **MakerDAO (MKR):** Utilizes stability fees and buy-and-burn mechanisms to maintain DAI's peg. Amplified could explore buyback and burn strategies for amplETH LP tokens to regulate supply and support price stability, especially during early growth phases.
